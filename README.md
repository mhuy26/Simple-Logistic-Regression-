# Advertisement Click Prediction
## Welcome to the Advertisement Click Prediction project! This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether an internet user will click on an advertisement based on various features of the user. The dataset used in this project contains information on user behavior and demographic details.

# Dataset Overview
## The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

### Daily Time Spent on Site: Consumer time on site in minutes.
### Age: Customer's age in years.
### Area Income: Average income of the geographical area of the consumer.
### Daily Internet Usage: Average minutes per day the consumer spends on the internet.
### Ad Topic Line: Headline of the advertisement.
### City: City of the consumer.
### Male: Whether or not the consumer is male (binary: 0 or 1).
### Country: Country of the consumer.
### Timestamp: Time at which the consumer clicked on the ad or closed the window.
### Clicked on Ad: Indicator of whether the consumer clicked on the ad (binary: 0 or 1).

# Libraries Used

### pandas (pd): Data manipulation and analysis.
### numpy (np): Numerical operations.
### seaborn (sns): Statistical data visualization.
### matplotlib.pyplot: Plotting and visualization.
### sklearn.linear_model: Linear model implementations.
### sklearn.model_selection: Tools for model selection and evaluation.
### train_test_split: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
### sklearn.metrics: Metrics for evaluating model performance.
### classification_report: Detailed performance report.
### confusion_matrix: Matrix for evaluating classification performance.

# Project Workflow
Data Exploration and Visualization: Analyze and visualize the dataset to understand its structure and features.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle any missing values or inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Extract and create relevant features for the predictive model.
Model Building: Train a machine learning model to predict ad clicks based on user features.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using various metrics and refine it as necessary.
